# CSRFbypass
This directory contains tools and scripts for bypassing CSRF protections. Use responsibly and ensure compliance with applicable laws and ethical guidelines.

example usage:
```bash
./CSRFbypass.bash "http://example.com/login?usrname=admin&password=HIT" /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```
I would still recomend using cewl to make a custom wordlist or any wordlist making script.
I will update curlBrute to have silent output and only output a successfull hit someday.
